# MBRL-Lib

![pic](README.assets/pic.jpeg)
This repo contains a unified opensource code implementation for the Model-Based  Reinforcement Learning methods.(@TJU). MBRL-Lib provides implementations of popular MBRL algorithms as examples of how to use this library. You can find them in the MBRL-Lib folder. Currently, we have implemented Dreamer, MBPO, MuZero, we plan to keep increasing this list in the future. **We present one of the most comprehensive Model-Based  library so far , which covered most mainstream algorithms in Model-Based RL area.** This repo will be constantly updated to include new researches made by TJU-RL-Lab. (The development of this repo is in progress at present.)

## Introduction

Reinforcement learning algorithms can be divided into two main categories: **the first category is `Model Free` methods, which are able to learn a value function or a strategy function directly by interacting with the environment without modeling the environment; the second category is `Model Based` methods, which need to model the environment by interacting with it and then use the model to make action planning or strategy selection**. The model free algorithm has achieved great results in many experimental scenarios and game environments due to its simple implementation and high asymptotic performance, but the sampling efficiency of the model free method is extremely low, resulting in a large number of interactions with the environment. However, the model free class of methods is extremely inefficient in terms of sampling efficiency and requires a lot of interaction with the environment. In contrast, the model based algorithm models the environment and fits the dynamics model of the environment **with high sampling efficiency**.

The model model of the environment is actually a representation model that explicitly contains knowledge about the environment or the task, and generally two types of models are included: a transition model or a dynamics model and the reward model. Once this model is modeled, it can be properly integrated into the interaction with the environment and the learning of strategies, as shown in the above figure. Following the guidance by Igor Mordatch (Google) and Jessica Hamrick (DeepMind) in [ICML 2020 Tutorial](http://sites.google.com/view/mbrl-tutorial), the core three directions for future work in MBRL are `faster planning`、`higher tolerance to model error`、`scalability to harder problems`.

There are many different ways to classify the mainstream algorithms in modern Model-Based RL area. For example, we can simply divide `Model-Based RL` into two categories: `Learn the Model` and `Given the Model`.

- `Learn the Model` mainly focuses on how to build the environment model.

- `Given the Model` cares about how to utilize the learned model.

From the perspecive of action execution, we can also divide `Model-Based RL` into two categories: `policy learning` and `planning`. 

- `policy learning` mainly focuses on trainning a parametric policy network explicitly. 

- `planning` cares about how to optimize the action sequence implicitly.

There are many other classification and we can list some of them here. From the perspective of dynamics model, we can divide dynamics models into three categories:`forward model`、`reverse/backward model` and `inverse model`. From the perspective of estimation method, the methods can be categorized as`parametric ` and `non-parametric` or `exact` and `approximate`. From the perspective of planning updating, the methods can be categorized as `value update ` and `policy update`.

What's more, these perspectives to divide the algorithms are orthogonal, which means some algorithms can be grouped into different categories according to different perspectives.But even with this, we have to admit that it’s really quite hard to draw an accurate, all-encompassing taxonomy of algorithms in the Model-Based RL space, because the modularity of algorithms is not well-represented by a tree structure.  **So we think it would be more appropriate to give the algorithm to a specific topic rather than a simple classification.** Moreover, we will publish a series of related blogs to explain more Model-Based RL algorithms. For a more detailed tutorial of this taxnomy, we refer the reader to our [ZhiHu blog series](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/425318401).
